When I initialize a repository, it seems to create the .git hidden file, which I suppose contains the basic framework of all the data and meta-data which git will store there when I start making commits

The staging area seems to be a kind of commit-in-progress.  It seems to give a platform for creating commits

It appears that knowing when to make a new commit is more art then science.  

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I've programmed in TFS for a while where branches are a fairly heavy-weight operation, and the ability to do an easy branch just to experiment a little, or change subject, or make a small bug fix, and then switch back easily seems immediately useful
