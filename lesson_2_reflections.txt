When I initialize a repository, it seems to create the .git hidden file, which I suppose contains the basic framework of all the data and meta-data which git will store there when I start making commits

The staging area seems to be a kind of commit-in-progress.  It seems to give a platform for creating commits

It appears that knowing when to make a new commit is more art then science.  

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I've programmed in TFS for a while where branches are a fairly heavy-weight operation, and the ability to do an easy branch just to experiment a little, or change subject, or make a small bug fix, and then switch back easily seems immediately useful

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The chain of references that makes up the "Real" branch structure is somewhat extract, and visualizing it as a tree of branches both makes it possible to process a structure of interrelated chains in one chunk, and to better understand the relationships between paths.
