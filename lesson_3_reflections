When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would certainly create a remote repository for any code that I wanted to share or collaborate with other people on.

And of course, history shows that any computer files which aren't backed up in the cloud will get lost eventually.  So I would probably keep any project which I have invested significant time in remotely.
